Solutions for Roadmap.sh Projects

https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv

This project aims how to create a structured, single-page CV using only HTML. You'll focus on organizing key sections—such as personal information, education, skills, and career history—using semantic HTML tags for clean and readable markup. Styling and other enhancements, like CSS and interactivity, will be introduced in future projects.

Key Points:
1) Features: Semantic HTML structure, no CSS or JavaScript.
2) Sections: Personal info, education, skills, and work experience.
3) How to Use: Clone the repository and open index.html to view the CV.
4) Future Enhancements: CSS styling and interactivity.
